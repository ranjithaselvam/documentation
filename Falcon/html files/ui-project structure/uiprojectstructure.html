    <h2>UI Project Structure</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>As a project manager structure is everything… there should be no such thing as a project without
        structure. A project organization is a <b>structure</b> that facilitates the coordination and
        implementation of<b> project activities</b>. Its main reason is to create an environment that
        fosters interactions among the team members with a minimum amount of disruptions, overlaps and
        conflict.</p>
    <p> <b>WHAT IS STRUCTURE?</b><br>
        <p> Structure in projects can be considered in two main forms: Planning & Approach. Planning is concerned with
            the “What”, “Who” and the “When”.</p>
