    <h2>UI Project Setup</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Right understanding of the definition and key characteristics of project is of significant importance. Any project is not just a way to make or do something but itâ€™s an opportunity to achieve some desired result by implementing a systematic management
        approach (for example, producing a product or sharing knowledge). An individual or organization involved in projects needs to understand how to solve complexity of problems through project management.
    </p>
    <p> <b>WHAT IS A PROJECT?</b><br>
        <p> Project is a great opportunity for organizations and individuals to achieve their business and non-business objectives more efficiently through implementing change. Projects help us make desired changes in an organized manner and with reduced
            probability of failure.</p>
