            <p><b><i>A</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Actual Result:</b> The system status or behaviour after you conduct a test. An anomaly or
                deviation is when your actual
                results differ from the expected results.</p>
            <p><b>Ad hoc Testing:</b> Testing carried out informally without test cases or other written test
                instructions.</p>
            <p><b><i>B</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Blackbox Testing:</b> Testing in which the test object is seen as a “black box” and the tester has
                no knowledge of its internal structure. The opposite of white box testing.</p>
            <p><b>Bug:</b> A slang term for fault, defect, or error. Originally used to describe actual insects
                causing malfunctions in mechanical devices that predate computers. The International Software
                Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) glossary explains that “a human being can make an error
                (mistake), which produces a defect (fault, bug) in the program code, or in a document. If a defect
                in code is executed, the system may fail to do what it should do (or do something it shouldn’t),
                causing a failure. Defects in software, systems or documents may result in failures, but not all
                defects do so.” See also debugging.</p>
            <p><b><i>C</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Code Standard:</b> Description of how a programming language should be used within an
                organization. See also naming standard.</p>
            <p><b>Configuration Testing:</b> A test to confirm that the system works under different configurations
                of hardware and software, such as testing a website using different browsers.</p>
            <p><b>Context-Driven Testing:</b> Testing which makes use of debugging techniques inspired by real-world
                usage conditions. It is a method of testing which encourages testers to develop testing
                opportunities based on the specific details of any given situation.</p>

            <p><b><i>D</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Debugging:</b> The process in which developers identify, diagnose, and fix errors found. See also
                bug and defect.</p>
            <p><b>Dynamic Testing:</b> Testing performed while the system is running. Execution of test cases is one
                example.</p>
            <p><b><i>E</i></b></p>
            <p><b>End-to-End:</b> Testing used to test whether the performance of an application from start to
                finish conforms with the behaviour that is expected from it. This technique can be used to identify
                system dependencies and confirm the integrity of data transfer across different system components
                remains.</p>
            <p><b>Expected Result:</b> A description of the test object’s expected status or behaviour after the
                test steps are completed. Part of the test case.</p>
            <p><b><i>F</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Failure:</b> Deviation of the component or system under test from its expected result.</p>
            <p><b>Functional Testing:</b> Testing of the system’s functionality and behaviour; the opposite of
                non-functional testing.</p>
            <p><b><i>G</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Gray-box-Testing:</b> Testing which uses a combination of white box and black box testing
                techniques to carry out software debugging on a system whose code the tester has limited knowledge
                of.</p>
            <p><b><i>I</i></b></p>

            <p><b>IEEE 829:</b> An international standard for test documentation published by the IEEE organization.
                The full name of the standard is IEEE Standard for Software Test Documentation. It includes
                templates for the test plan, various test reports, and handover documents.</p>
            <p><b>Integration Testing:</b> A test level meant to show that the system’s components work with one
                another. The goal is to find problems in interfaces and communication between components.</p>
            <p><b>ISTQB:</b> International Software Testing Qualifications Board. ISTQB is responsible for
                international programs for testing certification.</p>
            <p><b>Iteration:</b> A development cycle consisting of a number of phases, from formulation of
                requirements to delivery of part of an IT system. Common phases are analysis, design, development,
                and testing. The practice of working in iterations is called iterative development.</p>
            <p><b><i>L</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Load Testing:</b> A type of performance testing conducted to evaluate the behaviour of a component
                or system with increasing load, e.g. numbers of concurrent users and/or numbers of transactions.
                Used to determine what load can be handled by the component or system. See also performance testing
                and stress testing.</p>
            <p> <b><i>M</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Maintenance:</b> Activities for managing a system after it has been released in order to
                correct defects or to improve or add functionality. Maintenance activities include requirements
                management, testing, development amongst others.</p>
            <p><b>MTBF:</b> Mean time between failures. The average time between failures of a system.</p>
            <p><b><i>N</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Negative Testing:</b> A type of testing intended to show that the system works well even if it is
                not used correctly. For example, if a user enters text in a numeric field, the system should not
                crash.</p>
            <p><b>Non-Functional Testing:</b> Testing of non-functional aspects of the system, such as usability,
                reliability, maintainability, and performance.</p>
            <p><b><i>O</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Operational Testing:</b> Tests carried out when the system has been installed in the operational
                environment (or simulated operational environment) and is otherwise ready to go live. Intended to
                test operational aspects of the system, e.g. recoverability, co-existence with other systems and
                resource consumption.</p>
            <p><b>Outcome:</b> The result after a test case has been executed.</p>
            <p><b><i>P</i></b></p>
            <p><b>Pair Testing:</b>Test approach where two persons, e.g. two testers, a developer and a tester, or
                an end-user and a tester, work together to find defects. Typically, they share one computer and
                trade control of it while testing. One tester can act as observer when the other performs tests.

            <p><b>Performance Testing:</b> A test to evaluate whether the system meets performance requirements such
                as response time or transaction frequency.</p>
            <p><b>Positive Testing:</b> A test aimed to show that the test object works correctly in normal
                situations. For example, a test to show that the process of registering a new customer functions
                correctly when using valid test data.</p>
            <p<b>Priority:</b> The level of importance assigned to e.g. a defect.</p>
                <p><b><i>Q</i></b></p>
                <p><b>Quality Assurance(QA):</b> Systematic monitoring and evaluation of various aspects of a
                    component or system to maximize the probability that minimum standards of quality are being
                    attained.</p>
